# wpg-weatherchan
This creates the old-school looking weather channel that was common on Winnipeg cable TV into the 1990s.

## Usage

This uses 'ECData' from env_canada to get the weather data from Environment Canada. It can be found here: https://github.com/michaeldavie/env_canada

It was tested on a Raspberry Pi 3, but should run on other models as well. Because it uses tkinter, it must be launched from the GUI in raspbian. 

I recommend disabling screenblank, and turning on overscan for best results.
